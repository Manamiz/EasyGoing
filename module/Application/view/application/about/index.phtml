       <p>
          Easygoing started as a school semester project during which we also had a lot of other projects and works to do.<br/>
          It was a good experience for us because of the difficulty to manage several works at the same time, but we are proud to announce it was a success!
       </p>
       <p>
          We discussed a lot and decided to create a projects management website.<br/>
          After a few months we are now excited to show you <i>our</i> own project ; feel free to use it at your convenience! &#9829;
